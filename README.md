## Introduction

Connect-4 is a two-player game whereby each player takes turns dropping a coloured disk into one of the top 7-slots at the top of the `7x6` board. The game is continued until one player successfully creates a 4-disk line of their disks, running either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If there are no more empty cells on the board and noone has won, the game is considered a draw.
